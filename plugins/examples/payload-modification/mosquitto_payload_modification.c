/*
 * This is an *example* plugin which demonstrates how to modify the payload of
 * a message after it is received by the broker and before it is sent on to
 * other clients. 
 *
 * You should be very sure of what you are doing before making use of this feature.
 *
 * Compile with:
 *   gcc -I<path to mosquitto-repo/include> -fPIC -shared mosquitto_payload_modification.c -o mosquitto_payload_modification.so
 *
 * Use in config with:
 *
 *   plugin /path/to/mosquitto_payload_modification.so
 *
 * Note that this only works on Mosquitto 2.0 or later.
